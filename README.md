# DisplaySpecifications-Scrapy

## Overview

DisplaySpecifications-Scrapy is a web scraping project built using Scrapy framework to extract display specifications from various sources like websites and online stores. The project is designed to fetch detailed information about display panels, including their resolutions, sizes, refresh rates, panel types, and other relevant specifications. By utilizing Scrapy's capabilities, this tool aims to provide a comprehensive dataset of display specifications for analysis and comparison purposes.

## Features

- **Data Parsing**: Processes the scraped data to extract relevant information such as resolution, size, panel type, etc.
- **Data Storage**: Saves the collected data in structured formats like CSV, JSON, or database for easy retrieval and analysis.
- **Configurable**: Allows users to specify target websites, data extraction rules, and storage preferences.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle large-scale scraping tasks efficiently by managing requests, responses, and data pipelines effectively.
